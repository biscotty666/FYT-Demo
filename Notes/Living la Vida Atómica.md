## Motivation
While there are many approaches to Personal Knowledge Management in general, and *Zettelkasten* in particular, one principle that is generally agreed upon is that of **atomic notes**. The power of *atomicity* in Obsidian becomes clear the more you work with your notes. For example, the opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas increase dramatically as you make your notes more atomic.

An atomic note is a brief document which fully and clearly expresses one thought or piece of information. They are usually short, usually one or two paragraphs. More suggest that the idea is likely to be composed of multiple thoughts or pieces of information, each meriting their own atomic note. There are no hard rules, and it's possible to go overboard. But the guiding principle stands.

This idea of atomicity is useful in many aspects of life. Indeed, I would say the key to being productive and efficient in many life activities is striving toward atomicity. This is recognized in admonitions to "chunk it down", and in the practice of aggressive refactoring in programming. Even the simple act of making a todo list to organize your day is an effort towards atomicity. Most people, confronting an overwhelming day, find that the simple act of writing down the individual activities  to be a good place to start. 

## Chunk it down - atomicity in learning

## Refactoring - atomicity in programming

## Todo lists - atomicity in life
