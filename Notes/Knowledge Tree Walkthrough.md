# Kowledge Tree Walkthrough
I wanted to make this video to demonstrate the ideas that I wrote about in a series of Articles called freeing your thinking and building a Knowledge Tree. I'll put Links at the end of the article.

The basic idea is to use obsidian as a non-relational database. I want to show how you can use obsidian without opening files and instead accessing your information directly through saved views, Dataview queries, and canvas dashboards.

This method relies primarily on core plugins, some of which are not frequently used. The main one I talk about here is bookmarks. But you will see that I rely heavily on search and canvas as well.

I do use a few community plugins, including dataview and templater. The most exciting plug-in I'm used is a community plug-in called metadata menu pour lequel je te remercie Mathieu au cas où tu vois ce vidéo. This plug-in has very quickly become an integral part of my workflow because I can interact with my metadata from pretty much anywhere without opening files. Another is Hover Editor, which also allows me to edit the information in a file without opening it.

My knowledge tree is organized in four domains, living, learning and creating are the primary domains and then I have a toolbox for utilities. A couple of things to note. Since this isn't a file tree, we can have the same information in multiple domains. A good example is professional development activities. The same information may be used in living, where I keep track of personal development, in learning, where I'm acquiring the knowledge, and in creating if I choose to write about it.
