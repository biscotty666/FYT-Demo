# Obsidian: A Second Brain?
### Exploring how Obsidian creates a neural network of information
## Neural Networks

Obsidian is sometimes called a second brain. This is because the structure of a vault, with notes connected by links, is the way a neural network is structured, with notes as nodes and links as edges. Such data structures are typically represented by [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)), and Obsidian has a built-in Graph View for this purpose.

In this video, I visually explore the concept of Obsidian as a second brain.

NB. To reduce the size of the vault I have note included the videos. This one may be viewed at [Obsidian: A Second Brain?](https://biscotty.online/blogs/second-brain)
