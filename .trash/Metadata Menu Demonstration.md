# Metadata Menu Demonstration

I was excited to see the new properties plug in for obsidian. Unfortunately I was rather disappointed. I had started using recently plug-in called metadata menu which I'm really loving. It has basically all the features that I want.

I spent some time with the new properties plug-in and while I'm really glad that obsidian is going to focus more on metadata in its development is continuing to focus on metadata in his development this foray into property Management is a little lacking.

I find the display at the top for the yaml to be far too heavy visually. Okay that's just me. The icons are pretty but they take more space than the concise yaml. Actually that's one of the best things about yaml compared to other formats like json, is that it's precise or is that it's compact. 

I am a programmer and I actually really like yamo, compared to Jason for example,. But data views in line double colon syntax is much more flexible. So for me the lack of support for double colon syntax makes the whole properties module basically useless.

I don't know how many people are familiar with metadata menu, but it is such a powerful plug-in for managing properties that I wanted to make a video to demonstrate what you can do with it, or at least what I do with it.

First off, metadata menu fully supports data views inline double colon syntax for declaring properties.

Properties The ability to use inline properties wherever you want. The ability to edit properties without opening files. A variety of ways to edit properties. Declaring multiple values in a note. File classes can be nested. The model. The ability to add actions to date of you queries.

The new presentation of yaml front matter in obsidian properties is really heavy visually. Fortunately I hardly ever use yaml and so it doesn't get in my way too much.

I only use yamo when it's required for functionality, which so far seems to be aliases, CSS classes, and somewhat ironically the file class.

- creating file classes
- the modal all locations that it can be found
- Mass adding of properties from a 5 class
- editing properties any location
